# News-Headline-Clustering

Text Clustering:

The file text_to_cluster.txt contains around 650 lines. The lines/sentences are to be clustered into distinct groups using any clustering algorithm. The code is designed in a way such that the user can give as input a path to a text file, which will contain sentences as given in the "text_to_cluster.txt" file. The code algorithimically decides the optimum number of clusters if the clustering algorithm requires the number of clusters as input, for example kmeans requires k as input. So, for example, if the algorithm is kmeans, then the code decides the optimum k and not take k as input from the end user. The output of the clustering is to be written to a text file in the format given in "sample_output.txt".
